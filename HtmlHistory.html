            <h1>What is HTML</h1>
            <p class="content">HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used
                for creating web pages and web applications. Let&#39;s see what is meant by Hypertext
                Markup Language, and Web page.
                Hyper Text: HyperText simply means &quot;Text within Text.&quot; A text has a link within it, is
                a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you
                have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages
                (HTML documents) with each other.

                Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply
                layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text
                more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.</p>
            <h1>Brief History of HTML</h1>
            <p class="content">Tim Berners-Lee is known as the father of HTML. The first available description of
                HTML was a document called &quot;HTML Tags&quot; proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest
                version of HTML is HTML5.</p>

                            button, etc.
